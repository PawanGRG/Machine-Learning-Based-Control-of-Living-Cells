# Machine Learning Based Control of Living-Cells
This GitHub repository showcases my technical project that I completed during my Master's in Engineering Mathematics in Univeristy of Bristol. This project focused on exploring the application of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in the field of Cybergenetics control, more specifically the aim was to showcase the potential of Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) techniques to control complex systems in the domain of Cybergenetics.

## Goals of the study
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the PPO algorithm in the context of Cybergenetics. PPO, a reinforcement learning technique, was employed to control a complex and unstable Genetic Toggle Switch (GTS) for extended durations. The project's focus on the control of dynamic and unpredictable systems is crucial in assessing the feasibility of using MFRL techniques in real-world applications.
